# My solution for MIT 6.S081

Just some of my implementation. For the original version, please visit the xv6 repo.

# Introduce

This repo contains my solution of each lab. I use more detailed comments and include some insights from each lab which can be found in `README.md`. Also, I give the modified files and the corresponding `xxx.diff` files, which can be found in the directory of each lab. Hope you will find it helpfulðŸ˜˜.

# One More Thing...

I am still in process in learning English and coding, so there may be some problemsðŸ˜‚. If you have any questions, whether in solution, course or something else, feel free to open an issue.
